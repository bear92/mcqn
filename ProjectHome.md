This was a place to keep any code open-sourced by [MCQN Ltd.](http://www.mcqn.com)

Most of MCQN Ltd's released source code now resides on the [MCQN Ltd github account](https://github.com/mcqn/) (although a few things, most notably the Arduino [HttpClient library](https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient), are on [Adrian McEwen's github account](https://github.com/amcewen/))
